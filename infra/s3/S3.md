# S3 Bucket for IAM Dashboard

## 🎯 What This Does
Creates an S3 bucket to store scan results and data for the IAM Dashboard project.

## 📁 Files Created
- `infra/s3/main.tf` - Main S3 bucket configuration
- `infra/s3/variables.tf` - Input variables
- `infra/s3/outputs.tf` - Output values

## 🔧 What Was Fixed
- ✅ **Region**: Changed from `us-east-2` to `us-east-1` (matches our AWS setup)
- ✅ **Organization**: Put S3 files in dedicated `infra/s3/` folder
- ✅ **Removed**: Duplicate `package.json` file (already exists in project)
- ✅ **Security**: Added encryption, versioning, and public access blocking

## 🚀 How to Deploy
```bash
cd infra/s3
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
